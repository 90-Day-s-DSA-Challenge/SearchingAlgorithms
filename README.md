# Searching Algorithms

### What is Searching Algorithms?
Any algorithm which soslves the search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, either with discrete or continuous values.

Search algorithms are designed to check or retrieve an element from any data structure where that element is being stored. They search for a target (key) in the search space.

### Types of searching algorithms
1. Linear or Sequential Search
2. Binary Search
